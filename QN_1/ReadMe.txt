
Linked List:

Approach:
Implemented a singly linked list with basic operations such as insertion at the start or end, removal from start or end, and traversal.

Complexities:

Time:
Insertion/Removal at Start/End: O(1)
Traversal: O(n)
Space: O(n) for n elements in the linked list.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Max Binary Heap :

Approach:

Implemented a max binary heap with functions for adding an element while maintaining the heap property, removing the maximum element, and basic heapification.

Complexities:

Time:
Add/Remove Max: O(log n)
Heapify Down/Up: O(log n)
Space: O(n) for n elements in the heap.

Dequeue using Linked List:


Complexities:

Time:
Push/Pop Back/Front: O(1)
Space: O(n) for n elements in the deque.
